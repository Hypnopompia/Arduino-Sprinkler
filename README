This is an arduino project for an open source sprinkler control system.
* Requires an arduino with an Atmega328 or higher.
* Optionally uses EthernetDHCP.h from http://gkaindl.com/software/arduino-ethernet
* Requires RTClib.h from https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib

Features:
* Telnet server using the Wiznet ethernet module
* Time functions using a DS1307
* Controls transistors, triacs, relays or solid state relays via a 74HC595 shift register.
* Watering Zones that can be manually turned on or off via telnet.
* Scheduling to automatically turn zones on or off at certain times and days.
* Telnet based menu system to perform the following commands:

		save                               Save schedule to EEPROM
		exit                               Disconnect


Super simple schematic to wire up the atmega328 to the different components.

Notes:
	Whether a day is even or odd is calculated using the number of days since the Unix epoch, or Jan 1, 1970. This way, at the end of months with an odd number of days, we don't water twice in a row, or skip a day. Using this method gets us a nice consistent even/odd day pattern even though the current day of the month might not match with what the system calculates.
